                <h2>Ankh Comics Presents: The Brief History of Valiant Comics (Part Two)</h2>
                <p>In this documentary, created by C.E. Farley, we delve further into the rich history of Valiant Comics. The video was researched, written and edited by C.E. Farley, as part of a project to help inform readers of what Valiant Comics has to offer. As a long-time fan of Valiant Comics and a former manager at Florida's largest comic book store chain, Clint Farley has a unique and educated view of the comic book industry that spans from pre-war comics of the 1930's all the way up into the modern era. "Part Two" finishes up the Brief History of an underdog comic book company, that does not get the exposure it deserves.
