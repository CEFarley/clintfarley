            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello. My name is Clint Farley. I have been a freelance graphic artist, illustrator and animator for over 25 years. Whoa! That is a long time. What have I done, you ask? Well, I won the Northeastern Ohio Arts competition for an illustration that I did in 1994 while in school. My art hung on a wall in the Governor's office for over a year. Cool, right? I have worked on album art and concert posters for local bands in the Mid-Ohio Valley.</p>

                    </figure>
                </div>
            <p>Designed a few band logos as well. Those bands are probably no one you have heard of, as they were local and probably no longer exist. I have also dabbled in concept design for a very small indie video game developer, Backyard Ninja Designs. Mostly for character designs and even a few illustrations and animations used in-game. I participated in gametesting for several games that were being developed. I've also did a bit of voice acting for video game characters and an animated short film. Mostly sound effects and character reactions. Again, nothing you have ever heard of.</p>

            <h2>Ancient History</h2>
            <p>I attended the Art Institute of Pittsburgh (AIP) for computer animation. I enjoyed the hand-drawn portion of animation much more than the computer generated aspects. It was in college that I worked on boardgame design with a small group of creative AIP students. We developed a few games and even published one of them locally for a gaming store in Pittsburgh, Pennsyvania. This was in 1999 and the game has since vanished to the annals of history. I remember it being an rpg dungeon crawler with coopertive and competitive modes of play.</p>

            <p>In 1999 I joined the military, the United States Marine Corps. That was during an interesting time. Y2K was just around the corner. There was a lot of fear of war, of collapsing computer software, etc... this was of course, before the September 11th attack. While serving in the military I did freelance design work for several officers, which helped to keep my skills sharp. After the military, I returned to my home town of Marietta, Ohio, and tried to find myself. It seems I wasn't there anymore and the city flooded (twice), so I moved to Central Florida in 2006. I would continue to do freelance graphic design jobs while also working a full-time day job.</p>

            <h2>Covid19 and Beyond</h2>
            <p>In the middle of the Covid19 Pandemic, I started working at the largest chain of comic book stores in Florida. After a month, I was promoted to manager. I went from part-time to full-time literally overnight. My knowledge of comics from the early days all the way up to yesterday was well-regarded in the company. I taught employees and customers how to grade comics, wrote brief history lessons to teach employees, and helped new readers find titles to read. It helped that I am familiar with Magic the Gathering, manga and anime, the toy industry, and old boardgames. I continued to add new information to my arsenal. Whoever said running a comic book store was easy, has never managed one. I had to keep up with ever-changing trends, track sales, complete weekly inventory counts, make pre-order estimates, schedule employees, hold events, deal with landlords, deal with theft, and also purchase items from customers similar in stlye to a pawn shop. Using my previous artistic skills, I assisted people in learning to paint miniatures for Dungeons and Dragons as well as Warhammer.</p>
                
                
            <p>Post Covid19 Pandemic, I decided to return to college once more, and acquire further education in graphic design and video production. First I had to relearn, how to learn. Sounds strange, but when you have been out of school for a long period of time, you naturally don't think like a student anymore. I have thus far, made the President's List twice, so I think I am doing well.<br>
            I started a YouTube channel to practice and maintain my video editing, photoshop, illustrator skills. The logo for the channel is a modified version of a school logo project and I created my own branded lower thirds. The channel utilizes my knowledge of, and passion for comics, games and toys.
